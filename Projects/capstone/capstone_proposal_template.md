## Proposal

### Domain Background
Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy, which makes it a very project to implement.



### Problem Statement

Stock market analysis is divided into two parts – Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.

Fundamental Analysis: involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance.
Technical Analysis: on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market.

our focus will be on the technical analysis part.

### Datasets and Inputs
i will be using data sets from  https://www.quandl.com/ to predict gold price in london.


### Solution Statement
I will be trying a few models(most likely linear regression) to predict the stock prices and using the data sets from the following website i will be able to have some test and evaluation data that i can evaluate.

### Benchmark Model
There are alot of benchmark models out there with linear regression algorithims that can be used to validate my results relative to the real stock price predicted data.

####Evaluation metric

The evaluation metric would be comparing the predicted number to the real stock price number at a certain time.



### Project Design

1-i will be pre-processing the dataset to achieve usable raw data.
2-i will  choose a suitable machine learning model (possibly more than one).
3-i will train the data using a part of my dataset.
4-i will test the data using another test data of my dataset.
5-i will calculate the accuracy.
6-i will tune my model parameters and calculate the model's accuracy till i achieve the highest accuracy i can achieve.
7-i will try the model on a real stock data if applicable.
